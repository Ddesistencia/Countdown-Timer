# Countdown-Timer

## Happy New Year 
For start this good programming year I gonna make a countdown timer to the end of the year so I can track what I do :D

Is too simple, but it's functional soo i think is a good start, "Have a good basics", and sorry to myself to being procrastinating this, I swear is just about rhytim, but I back to the track!
